In case you forgot how to do this or need a step-by-step guide here it is.

First make sure your track is .MP4 file. If it isn't you can convert it here: https://audio.online-convert.com/convert-to-ogg

Next name it 01/02/03.mp4. The number will define if it's track 1,2 or 3.

After that re-open Just Natsuki and it should play your track!




DO NOT COMPRIMISE ANY OF THE MP4s!! IF ANY ARE LOST THE GAME WILL CRASH!
