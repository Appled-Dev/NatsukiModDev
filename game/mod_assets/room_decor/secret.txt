Hey! You found my seeeeeccccccrrrreeeetttt file! Your reward is you get to know a little fact about me!

I'm trans! Trans woman to be specific. Edgar isn't my name.
I don't tell people this cuz they don't really need to know. I'm just a mod developer I don't think I need to come out yknow?
I just told ya here, cuz it's pride month! Might as well!

I'd rather you don't go teeling everyone this. I won't deny it but like, chances are they won't believe you anyway.
Just, maybe keep this a secret? Hehe.

Also if you now hate because of this, than I must ask why you're willing to hate someone you don't know over something like this, but hey everyone's got their weird hangups I guess.
